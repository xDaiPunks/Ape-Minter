## Security Notice

Although this script asks for your private key to perform transactions, it does not store your private key anywhere. Your private key is used only within the runtime of the script and then discarded.

However, you should always be careful when using scripts that handle sensitive information such as private keys. Never disclose your private keys to anyone, and be sure to verify the trustworthiness and security of any script you use. Be aware of the risks involved in handling cryptographic keys, and consider the security of the computer system you are using.
